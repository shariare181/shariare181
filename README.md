Senior copywriter & author  
SEO • Conversion copy • Brand voice • UX writing

I work at the intersection of **language, strategy, and clarity**.

My focus is on writing copy that:
- ranks without sounding robotic  
- converts without manipulation  
- explains complex ideas without noise  

From brand websites and UX microcopy to long-form content and narrative systems, I build words that do real work.

## What I care about
- Clarity over cleverness  
- Structure before style  
- Meaning before metrics  

Good copy isn’t loud. It’s precise.

## What you’ll find here
This GitHub is a living workspace for:
- content systems & structure experiments  
- writing frameworks translated into code  
- personal portfolio projects  
- documentation, notes, and drafts  

Some repos are polished. Some are raw. All are intentional.

## Currently exploring
